feat(T2): hide livestreaming features from UI

- Added feature flag system in /lib/feature-flags.ts
- Conditionally hide 'Live Streams' navigation in fan layout
- Hide livestream stats and events in fan dashboard
- Hide 'Browse Live Streams' button when feature disabled
- Add middleware redirects for streaming routes when disabled
- Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_LIVESTREAMING=false in .env.local

All livestream code remains intact and can be re-enabled by setting the environment variable to 'true'.
