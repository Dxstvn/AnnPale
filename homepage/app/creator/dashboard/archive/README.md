# Creator Dashboard Archive

This directory contains archived versions of the creator dashboard that are no longer actively used but preserved for reference.

## Files

### `demo-dashboard-original.tsx`
- **Date Archived**: September 11, 2025
- **Description**: Original creator dashboard page that included both demo data and real data modes
- **Features**: 
  - Toggle between demo and real data
  - Comprehensive mock data structure with translations
  - Complex dashboard components (WorkflowStages, EmotionalJourney, CreatorPersona, etc.)
  - Multi-language support (English, French, Haitian Creole)
- **Reason for Archiving**: Simplified to use only real data version for better user experience

## Current Implementation
The current dashboard (`../page.tsx`) now uses only the `CreatorRealDashboard` component for a cleaner, production-ready experience.

## Restoration
If you need to restore the demo functionality, you can reference the archived version and integrate specific components as needed.
