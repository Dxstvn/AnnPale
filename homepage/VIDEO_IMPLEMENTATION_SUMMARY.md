# Video Upload & Payment System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive video management system with Supabase Storage, WebRTC recording, and intelligent payment method selection based on user geolocation.

## Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema (`/supabase/migrations/20250824_video_management_schema.sql`)
- **Tables Created:**
  - `video_requests` - Tracks fan requests for personalized videos
  - `videos` - Stores video metadata and storage paths
  - `transactions` - Payment records with multi-provider support
  - `video_access` - Controls who can view which videos
  - `creator_video_settings` - Creator preferences and pricing
- **Features:**
  - Comprehensive RLS policies for secure access control
  - Automatic triggers for status updates
  - Support for multiple payment providers (Stripe, MonCash)
  - Full indexing for optimal query performance

### 2. Storage Configuration (`/supabase/migrations/20250824_storage_buckets_setup.sql`)
- **Buckets Required:**
  - `creator-videos` (private) - Completed videos with RLS
  - `video-thumbnails` (public) - Preview images
  - `temp-recordings` (private) - In-progress recordings
- **Security:**
  - RLS policies ensure creators can only upload to their folders
  - Fans can only access videos they've purchased
  - Signed URLs for secure video streaming

### 3. TypeScript Types (`/types/video.ts`)
- Complete type definitions for:
  - Video requests and uploads
  - Payment providers and transactions
  - Geolocation data
  - Recording sessions
  - Creator settings and earnings

### 4. VideoRecorder Component (`/components/video/VideoRecorder.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - WebRTC MediaRecorder API integration
  - Camera/microphone selection
  - Real-time preview during recording
  - Pause/resume functionality
  - Countdown timer with max duration
  - Quality settings (720p, 1080p)
  - Download recorded videos
  - Direct upload to Supabase Storage
- **User Experience:**
  - Permission handling with clear error messages
  - Device selection UI
  - Recording status indicators
  - Progress tracking

### 5. Payment Method Selector (`/components/payment/PaymentMethodSelector.tsx`)
- **Intelligent Detection:**
  - Automatic geolocation detection
  - MonCash for Haiti users (HTG currency)
  - Stripe for international users (USD)
  - Automatic currency conversion display
- **Features:**
  - Processing fee calculation
  - Recommended payment method highlighting
  - Security badges and trust indicators
  - Responsive design

### 6. API Routes

#### Geolocation Detection (`/api/payments/detect-location/route.ts`)
- Detects user location using Vercel headers
- Falls back to IP-based detection
- Returns country, region, city, and currency
- Special handling for Haiti detection

#### Video Upload (`/api/videos/upload/route.ts`)
- Handles video file uploads to Supabase Storage
- Validates file type and size (max 500MB)
- Creates database records
- Grants access to purchasing fans
- Generates signed URLs for streaming
- Tracks view counts

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run the migrations in Supabase SQL editor
# 1. Run 20250824_video_management_schema.sql
# 2. Run 20250824_storage_buckets_setup.sql
```

### 2. Create Storage Buckets in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Storage section
2. Create bucket `creator-videos` (private, 500MB limit)
3. Create bucket `video-thumbnails` (public, 5MB limit)
4. Create bucket `temp-recordings` (private, 500MB limit)
5. Apply the RLS policies from the migration file

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### 4. Payment Provider Setup (Future)
- **MonCash**: Register at moncashdfs.com/business for Haiti payments
- **Stripe**: Set up Stripe account for international payments

## Usage Examples

### Recording a Video (Creator)
```tsx
import { VideoRecorder } from '@/components/video/VideoRecorder'

// In creator dashboard
<VideoRecorder
  request={videoRequest}
  maxDuration={180}
  onRecordingComplete={(blob, duration) => {
    // Handle completed recording
  }}
  onUpload={async (blob) => {
    // Upload to Supabase
    const formData = new FormData()
    formData.append('file', blob)
    formData.append('request_id', request.id)
    
    await fetch('/api/videos/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    })
  }}
/>
```

### Selecting Payment Method (Fan)
```tsx
import { PaymentMethodSelector } from '@/components/payment/PaymentMethodSelector'

<PaymentMethodSelector
  amount={25.00}
  onMethodSelect={(method) => {
    // Process payment with selected method
    if (method.provider === 'moncash') {
      // Handle MonCash payment
    } else {
      // Handle Stripe payment
    }
  }}
/>
```

## Security Considerations

1. **RLS Policies**: All tables have row-level security enabled
2. **File Validation**: Type and size checks on uploads
3. **Access Control**: Videos only accessible to purchasers
4. **Signed URLs**: Time-limited access tokens for streaming
5. **Payment Security**: No card details stored locally

## Implementation Progress vs Original Plan

### Completed Phases:
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Database Schema & Storage Setup (100%)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Payment Integration UI (70% - SDKs pending)
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Video Recording (90% - thumbnails pending)

### Remaining Phases:
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 4**: Creator Dashboard Updates (0%)
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 5**: Fan Dashboard Updates (0%)
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 6**: Video Access Control (50%)

## Next Steps (Following Original Plan)

   - Accept/decline functionality
   - Deadline tracking
2. **Video Recording Interface**
   - Integrate VideoRecorder component
   - Script display during recording
   - Preview before submission

3. **Watermarking**
   - Add creator branding

### Future Enhancements:
- Video analytics and insights
- Automated thumbnail generation
- Multiple video quality options
- Live streaming capabilities
- Video effects and filters
- Bulk upload functionality

## Technical Notes

- WebRTC requires HTTPS in production
- MonCash only supports HTG currency
- Video files stored in creator-specific folders
- Automatic status updates via database triggers
- Geolocation works best when deployed on Vercel

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check Supabase logs for storage/database errors
- Verify RLS policies are correctly applied
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Test with small video files first
