# Remote Deployment Steps for Music Superstars

## ‚úÖ **Status: Users Created, Tables Pending**

### üéµ **Auth Accounts Created in Remote Supabase**
The 3 musician users have been successfully created in the remote database:
- **Wyclef Jean** (wyclef.jean@annpale.demo): d963aa48-879d-461c-9df3-7dc557b545f9
- **Michael Brun** (michael.brun@annpale.demo): 819421cf-9437-4d10-bb09-bca4e0c12cba  
- **Rutshelle Guillaume** (rutshelle.guillaume@annpale.demo): cbce25c9-04e0-45c7-b872-473fed4eeb1d

All use password: `TempPassword123!`

### ‚ùå **Demo Tables Need to be Created**

The demo tables don't exist in the remote database yet. Please follow these steps:

## üìã **Manual Steps Required**

### Step 1: Apply Demo Tables Migration
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yijizsscwkvepljqojkz/sql
2. Click "New query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `scripts/apply-demo-migration-remote.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 2: Re-run Seeding Script
After the tables are created, run this command to populate the demo data:

```bash
cd /Users/dustinjasmin/AnnPale/homepage

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://yijizsscwkvepljqojkz.supabase.co" \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="REDACTED" \
npx tsx scripts/seed-music-profiles.ts
```

This will populate:
- Demo statistics
- Social media accounts
- Achievements
- Current projects
- Sample videos
- Reviews

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After running the seeding script, verify in Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication > Users
2. You should see the 3 musician accounts
3. Go to Table Editor
4. Check the following tables have data:
   - `demo_creator_stats`
   - `demo_creator_social`
   - `demo_creator_achievements`
   - `demo_creator_projects`
   - `demo_sample_videos`
   - `demo_reviews`

## üîç **Why This Happened**

You were looking at the **remote** Supabase instance (production), but we initially deployed to the **local** Docker container instance. 

- **Local deployment**: Complete and working (localhost:54321)
- **Remote deployment**: Users created, but demo tables need to be created

## ‚úÖ **Once Complete**

After following these steps, the remote Supabase will have:
- 3 fully functional musician creator accounts
- Complete demo data for each musician
- All profile information, stats, and content
- Ready for platform integration and testing

The musicians will then appear in your remote Supabase dashboard at:
