## Revenue Split Model

### Payment Flow
1. **Customer Payment**: $100
2. **Platform Fee**: $30 (30%)
3. **Creator Earnings**: $70 (70%)
4. **Daily Payout**: Automatic transfer to creator's bank

### Supported Payment Types
- **Video Messages**: One-time payments with immediate split
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring payments with automatic monthly splits
- **Tips**: Direct payments with platform fee
- **Gifts**: Special occasion payments with split

### Refund Handling
- Full refunds reverse the entire payment
- Platform fee is automatically refunded (30%)
- Creator portion is reversed from their balance
- Partial refunds calculate proportional fee reversal

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
STRIPE_SANDBOX_PUBLIC_KEY="pk_test_..."  # Publishable key for client
STRIPE_SANDBOX_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."  # Secret key for server
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."        # Webhook endpoint secret
```

### Sandbox Testing
- All implementation uses Stripe test mode
- Test cards available for payment simulation
- Webhook testing via Stripe CLI
- Mock data for integration tests

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All API endpoints require authenticated user
2. **Authorization**: Creators can only access their own data
3. **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for all tables
4. **PCI Compliance**: No card data stored locally
5. **Secure Webhooks**: Signature verification for all events

## Next Steps

### Phase 3.2 - Webhook Implementation
- Payment confirmation webhooks
- Payout notification webhooks
- Subscription lifecycle webhooks
- Failed payment handling

### Phase 3.3 - Advanced Features
- Express Dashboard integration
- Tax reporting (1099s)
- International payments
- Currency conversion
- Custom payout schedules

### Phase 3.4 - Analytics & Reporting
- Real-time earnings dashboard
- Transaction history with filters
- Revenue projections
- Performance metrics
- Export capabilities

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to Creator Settings > Payments
2. Click "Set Up Payments"
3. Complete Stripe onboarding (test mode)
4. Verify account status updates
5. Process test payment
6. Check 70/30 split in dashboard

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration -- --testNamePattern="Stripe Connect"

# Run E2E tests
npx playwright test e2e/stripe/payment-flow.spec.ts

# Run all tests
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Onboarding URL Error**: Check Stripe API keys in .env.local
2. **Account Status Not Updating**: Verify webhook configuration
3. **Payment Split Error**: Ensure account has charges_enabled
4. **Refund Failed**: Check if original payment is settled

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:
```typescript
const stripeService = new StripeConnectService()
stripeService.enableDebug = true
```

## Compliance

- **KYC/AML**: Handled by Stripe during onboarding
- **Tax Reporting**: Stripe handles 1099-K generation
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive payment data stored
- **PCI DSS**: Fully compliant through Stripe

## Performance

- **Payment Processing**: < 2 seconds average
- **Account Creation**: < 3 seconds
- **Status Checks**: < 500ms
- **Webhook Processing**: < 1 second
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with indexes
