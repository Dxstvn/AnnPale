  bio: "J Perry, born Jonathan Perry in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, is an internationally acclaimed singer, songwriter, and producer who has revolutionized contemporary Haitian music. Starting classical piano at age six under his godfather's guidance, J Perry developed a unique sound that fuses Haitian roots music, kompa, reggae zouk, and soca into an innovative Caribbean pop style. His breakthrough came with the 2011 debut album \"One Life To Live,\" featuring the meteoric hit \"Dekole,\" which became the 2012 Haitian Carnival theme song and earned him a Gold Disk Plaque from President Michel Martelly. Making history as the first Haitian artist to perform at Trinidad & London Carnival, J Perry has collaborated with over 60 international artists and Grammy-winning producers. His global appeal reached new heights when \"Bouje\" was featured in Disney's \"Cars 3.\" Beyond music, J Perry champions social causes through his Ede'n Ede foundation, advocating against youth bullying in Haiti while continuing to bridge cultural boundaries with his infectious Caribbean pop sound that resonates from Port-au-Prince to international stages.",
