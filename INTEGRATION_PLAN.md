# INTEGRATION_PLAN.md - Ann Pale Platform Frontend Integration Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan for integrating all frontend components built across Phases 0-5 into the Ann Pale platform. The plan addresses both enhancing existing pages and creating new essential pages to complete the platform's functionality. All demo pages (phase-*-demo) were development tests and will not be part of the final site.

### Key Objectives
1. **Enhance Existing Pages**: Upgrade current pages with advanced components
2. **Create Missing Pages**: Build essential pages for complete user, creator, and admin flows
3. **Apply Design System**: Ensure consistent design language across all pages
4. **Prioritize Core Business**: Focus on revenue-generating features first
5. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure accessibility, performance, and user experience standards

### Current State
- **Existing Functional Pages**: Homepage, Browse, Login/Signup, Creator Profile, Basic Dashboards
- **Components Built**: 300+ components across all phases (currently in demo pages)
- **Design System**: Fully documented but not consistently applied
- **Missing Critical Pages**: Booking flow, checkout, video delivery, complete dashboards
