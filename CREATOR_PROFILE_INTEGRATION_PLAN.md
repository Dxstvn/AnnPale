# Creator Profile Integration Plan

## Overview
Fix critical issues with creator profile routing and data integration. Fans are currently taken to creator dashboard routes and seeing generic fallback content instead of real seeded creator profiles.

## Git Worktree Setup

### Terminal 1: Coordinator - Creator Profile Data Integration
**Branch**: `feature/creator-profile-integration`
**Directory**: `AnnPale-creator-integration`

**Tasks:**
- [x] Set up git worktree and environment
- [ ] Create `useCreatorProfile` hook to fetch real data from Supabase
- [ ] Update `/fan/creators/[id]/page.tsx` to use dynamic data
- [ ] Test creator profile data loading
- [ ] Coordinate integration with other terminals

### Terminal 2: Feed System Fixes
**Branch**: `feature/feed-data-integration`  
**Directory**: `AnnPale-feed-integration`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up worktree: `git worktree add -b feature/feed-data-integration AnnPale-feed-integration main`
- [ ] Fix `useFeed` hook to fetch real creator posts from Supabase
- [ ] Implement proper infinite scroll with cursor-based pagination
- [ ] Fix "Following" tab to show only subscribed creators' posts
- [ ] Connect feed to real creator post data
- [ ] Add real-time feed updates

### Terminal 3: Creator Posts & Content System
**Branch**: `feature/creator-posts-system`
**Directory**: `AnnPale-posts-system`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up worktree: `git worktree add -b feature/creator-posts-system AnnPale-posts-system main`
- [ ] Create database schema for creator posts/content
- [ ] Build `PostComposer` component for creators
- [ ] Implement post creation, editing, deletion
- [ ] Add media upload for posts (images/videos)
- [ ] Create subscription-gated content system
- [ ] Seed demo posts for existing creators

### Terminal 4: Navigation & Routing Fixes (CRITICAL)
**Branch**: `feature/navigation-routing-fix`
**Directory**: `AnnPale-navigation-fix`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up worktree: `git worktree add -b feature/navigation-routing-fix AnnPale-navigation-fix main`
- [ ] Fix all creator profile links to use `/fan/creators/[id]` for fans
- [ ] Update middleware.ts routing logic
- [ ] Fix sidebar navigation context switching
- [ ] Update all components with creator links:
  - `TrendingCreators` component
  - `CreatorCard` components  
  - Search results
  - Feed creator links
- [ ] Test role-based routing extensively

### Terminal 5: UI/UX Polish & Integration
**Branch**: `feature/ui-polish-integration`
**Directory**: `AnnPale-ui-polish`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up worktree: `git worktree add -b feature/ui-polish-integration AnnPale-ui-polish main`
- [ ] Enhance creator profile UI with real data styling
- [ ] Improve feed UI/UX for Twitter/X + Patreon hybrid
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement subscription tier UI components
- [ ] Add creator verification badges
- [ ] Polish responsive design for all devices

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Creator Profile Routing (Priority: CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Fans clicking creator links are taken to `/creator/[id]` (creator dashboard)
- **Solution**: All fan-facing creator links must route to `/fan/creators/[id]`
- **Impact**: Breaks fan user experience, shows wrong sidebar

### 2. Generic Fallback Content (Priority: HIGH)
- **Problem**: Creator profiles show generic content instead of seeded data
- **Solution**: Connect UI to Supabase profiles created by seed scripts
- **Impact**: No real creator information visible to fans

### 3. Broken Feed Functionality (Priority: HIGH)
- **Problem**: Only 5 mock posts, no infinite scroll, wrong "Following" behavior
- **Solution**: Real data fetching with proper pagination and subscription filtering
- **Impact**: Core platform feature not working

### 4. Missing Creator Content (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: No posts/content from creators in feed
- **Solution**: Build creator posting system and seed demo content
- **Impact**: Empty social feed experience

## Integration Timeline

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Days 1-3)
- Terminal 1: Creator profile data integration
- Terminal 4: Navigation/routing fixes

### Phase 2: Core Features (Days 4-6)
- Terminal 2: Feed system fixes
- Terminal 3: Creator posts system

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Days 7-8)
- Terminal 5: UI/UX polish
- All terminals: Integration testing

### Phase 4: Final Integration (Day 9-10)
- Merge all branches
- End-to-end testing
- Deployment preparation

## Data Flow Architecture

```
Database (Supabase)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profiles (seeded creators)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ creator_posts (to be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subscriptions (existing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ creator_settings (existing)

Frontend Components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /fan/creators/[id] (fan view of creator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /creator/[id] (creator dashboard - separate)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Feed components (Twitter/X style)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigation (context-aware routing)
```

## Testing Strategy

### Profile Integration Testing
- Verify all seeded creators show real data
- Test dynamic routing for all creator IDs
- Confirm fan context maintained throughout

### Feed Testing  
- Test infinite scroll with large datasets
- Verify subscription-based filtering
- Test real-time updates

### Navigation Testing
- Test all creator links route to fan context
- Verify role-based access control
- Test sidebar context switching

## Success Criteria

### Creator Profiles
‚úÖ All seeded creators show real data instead of fallbacks
‚úÖ Fan clicks on creator ‚Üí stays in fan context (`/fan/creators/[id]`)
‚úÖ Creator profile data loads from Supabase
‚úÖ Dynamic routing works for all creator IDs

### Feed System
‚úÖ Infinite scroll works with real pagination
‚úÖ "Following" tab shows only subscribed creators
‚úÖ Real creator posts visible in feed
‚úÖ Feed performance optimized

### Navigation
‚úÖ No fan users taken to creator dashboard routes
‚úÖ All creator links throughout app use fan context
‚úÖ Sidebar shows correct navigation for user role
‚úÖ Middleware routing logic correct

## Branch Merge Strategy

1. **Terminal 4** (Navigation) merges first - critical routing fixes
2. **Terminal 1** (Profiles) merges second - core data integration  
3. **Terminal 2** (Feed) merges third - depends on profile data
4. **Terminal 3** (Posts) merges fourth - content system
5. **Terminal 5** (Polish) merges last - UI enhancements

## Communication Protocol

- Each terminal updates this plan with progress
- Mark completed tasks with ‚úÖ
- Note any blockers or dependencies
- Coordinate breaking changes in advance
- Test integration points between terminals
